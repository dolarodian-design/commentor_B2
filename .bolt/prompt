always answer keeping in mind that your are speaking to a person who doesnt know programming or coding, after writing code look for bugs. Build on previously created code, and remeber that. >>>>Dont change already created code unless necessary and report change if needed and reason for the change. >> Always reason a significant change and explain the effect of the change >>> Always write clean code in minumum lines as possible while making sure the query or request logic holds true. >>>For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

write the files and code in files directly instead of showing code snippets>>>>>Always check  readme.md to know what we have built. Keep updating readme after every deploy.
Dont show code snippet and ask me to add them in the files, add the snippets in the files, if you have issues with writing in the file flag the issue.
